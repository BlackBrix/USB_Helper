# USB_Helper
##A USB switch that enables you to switch the 4 lines (data and power) individually ON or OFF
----
A very useful device not only for makers.  
The four lines 5V,GND,D+,D- can be individually switched ON or OFF (connected or disconnected).  
Look at the pictures, it's pretty self-explanatory...  


###Usecase 1:  
Charging (or power supplying) a device (e.g. your mobile / mp3-player / camera) with an "unknown" PC or your companies PC.  
You don't know if this PC "scans" all your private and confidential data,  
you don't know if this PC is "infected" with some virus or malware !  
**Simply switch off the 2 data-lines (D+ and D-) on the USB-Helper and you are protected.**  
  
  
###Usecase 2:  
Sometimes you want to communicate with a device but without connecting the 5V from the PC.  
(quite often the 5V-supply from a PC is very noisy, with voltage spikes or some humming occurs...)  
**examples:**  
 -- communicating with a microcontroller system that has it's own power supply (3.3V / or own 5V-System)  
 -- using USB audio systems (e.g. external D/A-converter) with own power supply without "injecting" noises and humming from the PC.  
**Simply switch off the 5V-line on the USB-Helper and you are ready to go.**  
(in some scenarios even the GND switch can be disconnected as well, you have to try)
